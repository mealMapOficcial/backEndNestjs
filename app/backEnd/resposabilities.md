### **Spring Boot** üå±

**Responsibilities for Spring Boot**:
1. **Inventory and Product Management**:

### **Interaction between NestJS and Spring Boot** ü§ù
- **NestJS as API Gateway**: Handles authentication and routes requests to Spring Boot for more complex operations.
- **Communication via REST**: Exchange data between NestJS and Spring Boot through REST APIs, such as inventory status, orders, and user details.
- **Shared Database**: Both applications use the same database, with Spring Boot handling heavier persistence logic while NestJS performs necessary reads and writes.

### Key Changes:
- **Order Management**: NestJS will take on more responsibility for order management and frontend integration.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Added to NestJS, using WebSockets to keep the frontend updated.
- **Menu and Reporting Management**: Assigned to Spring Boot, handling advanced CRUD operations and report generation.
